RethinkDBAudit.h and RethinkDBAuditTEMP.BIN are included as is in the build process.

If you change RethinkDBAudit.man, you need to regenerate the header file and the BIN file with the following commands:

mc RethinkDBAudit.man
mc -um RethinkDBAudit.man

Because one of our log levels is "Error", the RethinkDBAudit.h file that the Windows Message Compiler generates will have a naming conflict.
To fix this, the local variables named "Error" in the file will need to be renamed.
